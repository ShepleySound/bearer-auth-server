## Setup

### Running the application locally

- Ensure PostgreSQL is setup on your machine, and that you have an existing user with createdb permissions.

- Clone the repository to your local machine, then run the following commands in your terminal -

  ```bash
    npm install
    npm run db:config
    npm run db:create
    touch .env
  ```

- Add the following lines to the newly created `.env` file.

  ```text
  PORT=<port number>
  DATABASE_URL=postgres://localhost:5432/auth-api
  ```

- In the `config/config.json` file, set your username and password under the 'development' entry. Keep in mind, these both must be wrapped in double quotes.

- Run the following command -

  ```bash
    npm start
  ```

- Congratulations! You should now be able to access the application in your browser by navigating to `http://localhost:PORT/`, with `PORT` being the port number that you specified in the .env.
